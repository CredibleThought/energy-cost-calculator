# 📦 Energy Cost Calculator

This app allows you to calculate and view how much it costs to run electric devices

To use the calculator, set the following:
1. Peak and off-peak electricity rates (£/kWh).
2. For each device you want to add, set the following and then click "Add Device" or press Enter:
    a. Device name
    b. Maximum power used (Heavy Load). For example, when running gaming on a computer.
    c. Power used when operating at normal level (Regular Load). For example, when browsing the internet on a computer.
    d. Percentage of time device used under heavy load.
    e. Percentage of time device used under regular load.
    f. Number of hours the device is used at peak rate per day.
    g. Number of hours the device is used at off-peak rate per day.
3. Make sure that the percentages total to 100% and total hours of usage does not exceed 24.
4. As the devices are added the "Device List and Costs" and "Cost Breakdown" tables will be updated.
   And a pie chart will be created showing the relative power usage per device over a year
5. Repeat 2 and 3 for all devices you want to add.
6. Save the list using the "Save list to CSV" button.
7. A saved list can be loaded by dragging the csv file to where it says "Drag and drop file here". OR using the "Browse Files" button.

Note:
It is assumed the heavy and regular load percentages are the same at peak and off-peak times.
If you want to have finer control, then add a heavy and regular load version of the device.
